# CodeBook for project assignment of Week 4 in "Getting and Cleaning Data"

## for both files train_test.txt and train_test_mean.txt
The files have the following columns

activity
	telling what activity has been performed when the measurements of this row have been taken, possible values are:
		- WALKING
		- WALKING_UPSTAIRS
		- WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
		- SITTING
		- STANDING
		- LAYING
		
subject
	identifier of test persons, so different activities can be assigned to the same person for further investigations
		- 30 test persons are being referred by numbers 1 to 30
		
further columns are the measurements, where only the mean and standard deviations have been included into the files
